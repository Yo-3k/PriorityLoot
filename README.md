# PriorityLoot
Addon supporting loot distribution with priorities from 1-19

## Installation:
1. Download the latest "Source Code (zip)" from the release section
2. Extract the zip file "PriorityLoot-<version>"
3. Copy the folder "PriorityLoot" (inside of "PriorityLoot-<version>") to: \
   C:\<WoWInstallPath>World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\*
4. A successful installed PriorityLoot would for example contain a file like this: \
   C:\<WoWInstallPath>World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\PriorityLoot\PriorityLoot.toc

## Features:
- Works only in a raid
- The master looter is able to start and stop rolls (optionally with an auto-timer)
- Items to be rolled for can be either dragged into the item drop window or moved to the item window with shift-click.
  This works only if the shift-click option is enabled via a checkbox, to no interfere with the original WoW shift-click
  function in case PriorityLoot is not used.
- When a roll is finished, the master looter can auto-distribute the loot via the "Trade" button
- The first five participants of a roll are displayed as winners, in case multiple of the same item are distributed with one roll
- Individual priorities can be disabled via right-click on each client (not synchronized) to give a visual representation of the
  available priorities.
